# POKÉMON PER DAY
Catch one Pokémon every day! But only once per day!

This is a minimalist game in Python 3 and using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) service.

At the moment is only for playing into the terminal: no graphics, no sounds. But not will be allways to boring: the objective is to be a desktop game with a simple GUI (probably TKinter, still don't know).

If you take a look and have any correction or any idea feel free to write me! I am doing this project with the intention of mastering my developer skills, all feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Oh! I forgot: enjoy and gotta catch'em all!
